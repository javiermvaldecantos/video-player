# video-player
HTML5 video player built using JavaScript that makes use of CSS and jQuery animations. Provides a “theatre” mode and stores a list of watched videos with LocalStorage.

* How to use the app:
  In the root directory type the command 'node server.js' on the terminal. You will be prompted to go to http://http://localhost:8888/index.html. Type that URL on your web browser and you will see the video player! Check the theatre mode.

* App structure:
  In the root directory there are two elements. First, there's a server.js file, which contains the code for the Web server built on Node.js. Second, there's and a /www directory which contains HTML, CSS and JavaScript files that make up the video player.
